A few simple steps to make versioning more understandable

### Features

* Every version string consists of 2 parts: `Bundle Version String` (from `Info.plist` file) and `Git commit SHA1` (you always can find this commit in the repository timeline).

* You can display your unique app version on the splash screen or on the about screen.

* When you sending yet another build to your customers or testers, you're not afraid to get lost in application versions. Every bug or wish will be binded with the version code.

* Your AppStore users can send feedbacks from the special form and every message will be signed with the unique version code.

### How does it work?

This shell script runs every time you building your application. As the result - value of the macros `GIT_SHA_VERSION` (from `GitVersion.swift`) updates with the `SHA1-code` of the last branch commit.

## Installation Guide

1. Open `Build Phases` in Xcode

2. Press `Add Build Phase`

3. Press `Add Run Script Build Phase`. You can find this in the top menu `Editor`. Drag script-line to the position after `Target Dependencies`.

4. Set Shell line to ```/bin/sh```

5. Set contents of the gitversioning.sh (without first #-lines) to the script field. Don't forget to change Sources to your path-to-file, where `GitVersion.swift` should be. For example: ![Adding new Build Phase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denal05/GitVersioningOnXCode/master/xcode_screenshot.png "Adding new Build Phase")

6. Add the autogenerated `GitVersion.swift` file into Xcode project

7. Paste these lines:

```Swift

let myCFBundleShortVersionString = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["CFBundleShortVersionString"]  as? String
NSLog(myCFBundleShortVersionString! + "." + GIT_SHA_VERSION)
```
